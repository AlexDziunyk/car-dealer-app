# Nextjs Car Dealer App

## How to setup the project?
Run <code>npm i</code> to install all neccessaery packages. 
After that run <code>npm run dev</code> to run the app.

## What sctructure is used for?
The project is not that big to call it the whole structure, but I wanted to create something similar to Clear Architecture.
<ul>
  <li>Folder <code>components</code> has components that can reused in the app</li>
  <li>Folder <code>utils</code> has useful functions, arrays, objects and so on that can be used in the different parts of the project</li>
  <li>In theory, each component can have its own folder <code>components</code> that can be used only there</li>
  <li>Also, I'd like to add folder <code>hooks</code> and <code>context</code></li>
</ul>

## What technologies are used?
<ul>
  <li>Nextjs</li>
  <li>Typescript</li>
  <li>Tailwind</li>
  <li>Eslint and Prettier</li>
</ul>
